# advanced-db-integration-project
LMS Project for Advanced Database Development
Spring 2017

This is a project by Daniel Teichman and Rabeet Fatmi for
Advanced Database Development, a core graduate-level course at
Florida Polytechnic University.

This project demonstrates basic integration between a PostgreSQL
database or cluster and a Riak cluster.  This application demonstrates
basic features of a Learning Management System like Blackboard or
Canvas.

The location of the PostgreSQL coordinator and locations of Riak
nodes are configurable in the config.php file.

I recommend security for any Riak cluster. I used a software VPN,
which was cost-effective in the context of our project.
