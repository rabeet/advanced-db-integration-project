# Advanced Database Integration Project

LMS Project for Advanced Database Development Spring 2016

This is a project by Rabeet Fatmi and Daniel Teichman for Advanced Database Development, a core graduate-level course at Florida Polytechnic University.

This project demonstrates basic integration between a PostgreSQL database or cluster and a Riak cluster. This application demonstrates basic features of a Learning Management System like Blackboard or Canvas.

The location of the PostgreSQL coordinator and locations of Riak nodes are configurable in the config.php file.

I recommend security for any Riak cluster. I used a software VPN, which was cost-effective in the context of our project.
